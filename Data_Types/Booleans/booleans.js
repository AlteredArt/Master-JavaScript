// In JavaScript, a boolean value is one that can either be TRUE or FALSE. 
// If you need to know “yes” or “no” about something, then you would want 
// to use the boolean function. It sounds extremely simple, but booleans 
// are used all the time in JavaScript programming, and they are extremely 
// useful. Anything that needs to be “on” or “off”, “yes” or “no”, “true” 
// or “false”, or which just has a temporary purpose, is usually a good fit 
// for booleans.

// Below is an example of how to use booleans in JavaScript:

// EXAMPLE
var kitchenLights = false;
kitchenLights = true;
kitchenLights;
// OUTPUT
// true
// In this example, the variable "kitchenLights" being set to "true" would 
// indicate that the lights are on. If it was set to "false" then that would 
// mean they are off. It’s useful to store booleans in variables to keep 
// track of their values and change them over time. Booleans are used as 
// functions to get the values of variables, objects, conditions, and 
// expressions. In fact, Booleans are critical for conditionals to work. 

// In your code, when you need to know whether or not a condition is being 
// met before proceeding to the next step, the boolean function becomes 
// your best friend. If such and such is TRUE, then do this. If it is FALSE, 
// then do something else.

// Consider something simple like making a sandwich. In your head, you will 
// actually be going through a series of booleans and conditionals:

// Do I have bread? TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, then I can proceed to the next 
// step of whether or not I have mustard, ham, etc. If FALSE, then I’ll need 
// to go to the store to get some bread. And so on and so forth.

// You can never assume anything when programming - you have to write the 
// logic explicitly, and a large part of that is simply knowing whether or 
// not a condition is being met. Hence the importance of booleans in JavaScript.
